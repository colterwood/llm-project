And they don\\'t. Things get a lot more interesting when Lafata brings out the real guns, as on the Spaghetti Western-informed, dancehall romp of \"Nada\". His voice is naturally brutish, so when his ideas and arrangements are kept in focus, the Gold Chains growl gathers no moss-- in addition to making his occasionally affected Jamaican accent much easier to take.

Beyond awful. Listen, I know a lot of people out these parts didn't dig DFA79's mini-metalisms on You're A Woman, I'm A Machine-- too hard, too soft, too boring, not boring enough, vaguely misogynistic, etc. You wrote these things to me and I have all your emails in a file somewhere. But understand a simple, if not mathematical fact about this two-piece bass-and-drum duo: By necessity their songs have little to them. They're efficient bursts of less-is-more rock that ride riffs hard then cut out right before they stale. I'd have thought at least one motherfucker tapped for this turkey-shot remix project would have figured that out. Instead we get Justice on some reverso Advantage shit, making \\\"Blood on Your Hands\\\" sound like the theme to Super Pitfall, and that game's the fucking worst. Hey, let's talk Bloc Party's Silent Alarm Remixed, from which we might pretend Romance Bloody Romance took some Ps and Qs. SAR, remember, featured a different producer doing up a different track from the Bloc's debut. Then it came sequenced just like Silent Alarm, and a few of us (me) actually liked it better than the original LP-- more variety, less helicopters, etc. SAR at least made sense, since every Bloc track physically had a bunch of possible reconfigurations. Romance, meanwhile, has four telling remixes of \\\"Black History Month\\\" (the band's worst song), three of \\\"Romantic Rights\\\", an OK new song and a cover of former Peel favorite La Peste's \\\"Better Off Dead\\\". Inexplicably, nobody behind the papers realized after the second or third dude asked to remix \\\"Black History Month\\\" that maybe, maybe, DFA79's songs aren't suited for the full-on remix treatment-- they don't need it either. Listen, I respect the renewed interest in tripping up rock-kid disco homophobia (still rampant) with these Phoned-in remix blitzes of late. Vice Records, seems, is fighting the good fight. But the Braxe/Falke and D\\u00c3\\u00a4hlback joints here are so flimsy, that vocoder'd out Makuziak futuro-disco bullshit so obnoxiously tongue-in-cheek, I can't imagine anybody really psyched to hit up his neighb Fixed or Making Time party to try out his new Diesel hightops on the dancefloor. Final Fantasy's string arrangements for \\\"Black History\\\" have their charm, sure, but only Trash's Erol Alkan turns in the album's non-bomb, a simple edit of \\\"Romantic Rights\\\" that overlays percussion tracks for an intro and flips the vocal track a disorienting half-step early. Which is saying something: If the game is to make rock tracks playable in clubs, why fuck with them more than you have to? What's so bad about disco edits?\",\n          \"Die Rugged Man Die has the grit of a classic horror film. From the marshes of Long Island, a man-- better yet, a Rugged Man-- arises to deliver an album so drenched in self-deprecation that listeners bypass any notes of sympathy and gas themselves, if only in solidarity with R.A.'s overwhelming antipathy. R.A. the Rugged Man hates you, but he hates himself more. To be fair, the former Biggie collaborator has a lot to be angry about. Die Rugged Man Die is the autopsy of disaster as R.A. reflects on his heartbreaks and hostilities with a familial bluntness. By the early 90s, R.A.'s future beamed with opportunity. Russell Simmons and the Neptunes courted the raucous underground star before Jive scooped him up in '93. On the brink of celebrity, everything fell apart with Rube Goldberg precision, culminating in R.A.'s release from Jive after a sexual harassment suit and a carnivalesque CMJ showcase that prominently featured saloon-style brawling, tied-up prostitutes, and a gleefully urinating Rugged Man. Since then, R.A. has played the albatross, trekking the underground and garnering reputation as the Chupucabra of the underground. Aside from an appearance on Soundbombing, Vol. 1, R.A. has been an apparition, adding a celebratory import to his Nature Sounds debut. Now, the ghost finally speaks. No one can walk away from Die Rugged Man Die without a clear sense of who R.A. is: The man has a gift for autobiography and he draws the listener with the familiarity of a fireside, storytelling uncle. Granted he's the uncle who takes shits on your face while you sleep. Against Nilez' dawdling guitars on \\\"A Star is Born\\\", R.A. regurgitates his griminess as a Jive Records leper: \\\"'They say he's a beast, he's a creature/ Keep him in the other room, don't let him see Aaliyah.\\\" All vulgar showmanship aside, Rugged Man addresses subjects with clarity and humor. On the album's single \\\"Lessons\\\", he deftly caricatures the myopic label execs who stifled his career as a white rapper. Rising producer Koran pushes a pre-school child's vocals over Fischer-Price keyboards as R.A. jests: \\\"They say maybe if you had Dr. Dre or Timbaland/They say a white boy need a black boy to win/ Bubba Sparxxx did and so did Slim/ Just Blaze is hot. Why don't you get with him?\\\" Concerned with the trends of hip-hop consumers, R.A. fires a simple critique on the memory-lane ballad \\\"On the Block\\\": \\\"Now that rich kids love [hip-hop], so fuck the poor kids now.\\\" As a composite, however, Die Rugged Man fails to rework the well-worn, preachy \\\"mainstream=cancer\\\" equation. Aside from establishing his bad luck with majors, R.A.'s complaints often pose as a subconscious bid for sympathy, which is difficult considering his implosion from self-induced calamities. Why care about R.A's tales if he unflinchingly claims on \\\"Dumb\\\" that he doesn't give a fuck about his career? Nonetheless, the completion of Die Rugged Man is a triumph in itself. Hip-hop's Forrest Gump has seen almost everything and tells his story well. Let's hope things at Nature Sounds stay civil so we don't have to wait another decade for his next album.\",\n          \"The passage of time has done nothing to make the mid-\\u201990s heyday of Guided by Voices seem any less extraordinary. Released at the height of the band\\u2019s underground popularity in 1995, Alien Lanes supposedly cost $10 to make (excluding the cost of the beer consumed as it was recorded) while garnering GBV an advance worth nearly $100,000 from its new record label, Matador. GBV\\u2019s 37-year-old mastermind and only permanent member, Robert Pollard, had already been around a while, recording\\u00a0several albums in the \\u201980s and early \\u201990s that virtually nobody heard. But Pollard\\u2019s latest opus was a big deal:\\u00a0famous mastering engineer Bob Ludwig\\u00a0mastered Alien Lanes. (Among Ludwig's prior credits was Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska, possibly the most celebrated \\\"lo-fi\\\" album ever.) Upon release, Alien Lanes was greeted with a laudatory four-star review in Rolling Stone comparing GBV to the twin pillars of \\u201990s alt-rock, R.E.M. and Nirvana. \\u201cThe new drunk drivers/Have hoisted the flag,\\u201d Pollard sings on Alien Lanes\\u2019 opening track, \\u201cA Salty Salute.\\u201d The bravado was warranted. Bandcamp has since normalized the idea of a bedroom tunesmith from flyover country releasing a self-recorded masterpiece to the world, and getting semi-famous in the process. Will Toledo was once a high school kid from Virginia who wrote and recorded dozens of songs in the backseat of his parents\\u2019 car, and now Car Seat Headrest is one of 2016\\u2019s biggest new indie bands. But the lack of online distribution channels was hardly GBV\\u2019s only disadvantage before Alien Lanes. By the time GBV\\u2019s would-be swan song, 1992\\u2019s Propeller**, became a surprise critical hit, Pollard was a family man from Dayton, Ohio, who by rock\\u2018n\\u2019roll standards was over-the-hill. By day, he\\u00a0worked as an elementary schoolteacher, and on weekends, he blew off steam by getting drunk in his garage and laying down weird, succinct, and insanely catchy songs informed by \\u201960s and \\u201970s prog and psych-rock on a four-track machine with guys from the neighborhood. And for many years, that was basically the extent of Pollard\\u2019s music career. Even after GBV finally made its mark, Pollard\\u2019s unabashed devotion to the less\\u00a0fashionable sectors of classic rock (Peter Gabriel-era Genesis, Who\\u2019s Next, Cheap Trick)\\u00a0put him out-of-step with indie\\u2019s entrenched punk orthodoxy. \\u201cKing Crimson with a short attention span and a sixpack,\\u201d was how Craig Marks described Guided by Voices in the Spin Alternative Record Guide, published just as the band\\u2019s notoriety was peaking. While the King Crimson comparison would\\u2019ve flattered Pollard, it wasn\\u2019t meant as a compliment in the alt-era. What Guided by Voices lacked in traditional indie cool, it made up for in songs. So many, many songs\\u2014great songs, bad songs, OK\\u00a0songs that became good because they were short and worked as segues between the great songs. With 28 tracks dispensed in just 41 minutes, Alien Lanes offered up more songs than any other GBV album, and they were dense with in-jokes and non-sequiturs about a pimple zoo, the Amazing Rockethead, and Baron Von Richtofen, among other obscurities.

Beyond awful. Listen, I know a lot of people out these parts didn't dig DFA79's mini-metalisms on You're A Woman, I'm A Machine-- too hard, too soft, too boring, not boring enough, vaguely misogynistic, etc. You wrote these things to me and I have all your emails in a file somewhere. But understand a simple, if not mathematical fact about this two-piece bass-and-drum duo: By necessity their songs have little to them. They're efficient bursts of less-is-more rock that ride riffs hard then cut out right before they stale. I'd have thought at least one motherfucker tapped for this turkey-shot remix project would have figured that out. Instead we get Justice on some reverso Advantage shit, making \\\"Blood on Your Hands\\\" sound like the theme to Super Pitfall, and that game's the fucking worst. Hey, let's talk Bloc Party's Silent Alarm Remixed, from which we might pretend Romance Bloody Romance took some Ps and Qs. SAR, remember, featured a different producer doing up a different track from the Bloc's debut. Then it came sequenced just like Silent Alarm, and a few of us (me) actually liked it better than the original LP-- more variety, less helicopters, etc. SAR at least made sense, since every Bloc track physically had a bunch of possible reconfigurations. Romance, meanwhile, has four telling remixes of \\\"Black History Month\\\" (the band's worst song), three of \\\"Romantic Rights\\\", an OK new song and a cover of former Peel favorite La Peste's \\\"Better Off Dead\\\". Inexplicably, nobody behind the papers realized after the second or third dude asked to remix \\\"Black History Month\\\" that maybe, maybe, DFA79's songs aren't suited for the full-on remix treatment-- they don't need it either. Listen, I respect the renewed interest in tripping up rock-kid disco homophobia (still rampant) with these Phoned-in remix blitzes of late. Vice Records, seems, is fighting the good fight. But the Braxe/Falke and D\\u00c3\\u00a4hlback joints here are so flimsy, that vocoder'd out Makuziak futuro-disco bullshit so obnoxiously tongue-in-cheek, I can't imagine anybody really psyched to hit up his neighb Fixed or Making Time party to try out his new Diesel hightops on the dancefloor. Final Fantasy's string arrangements for \\\"Black History\\\" have their charm, sure, but only Trash's Erol Alkan turns in the album's non-bomb, a simple edit of \\\"Romantic Rights\\\" that overlays percussion tracks for an intro and flips the vocal track a disorienting half-step early. Which is saying something: If the game is to make rock tracks playable in clubs, why fuck with them more than you have to? What's so bad about disco edits?\\\"\\n\",\n          \"\\n    Artist: R.A. the Rugged Man,\\nAlbum: Die Rugged Man Die,\\nGenre: Rap,\\nScore (1-10): 7.5\\n    \\nAlbum review:\\n\\\"Die Rugged Man Die has the grit of a classic horror film. From the marshes of Long Island, a man-- better yet, a Rugged Man-- arises to deliver an album so drenched in self-deprecation that listeners bypass any notes of sympathy and gas themselves, if only in solidarity with R.A.'s overwhelming antipathy. R.A. the Rugged Man hates you, but he hates himself more. To be fair, the former Biggie collaborator has a lot to be angry about. Die Rugged Man Die is the autopsy of disaster as R.A. reflects on his heartbreaks and hostilities with a familial bluntness. By the early 90s, R.A.'s future beamed with opportunity. Russell Simmons and the Neptunes courted the raucous underground star before Jive scooped him up in '93. On the brink of celebrity, everything fell apart with Rube Goldberg precision, culminating in R.A.'s release from Jive after a sexual harassment suit and a carnivalesque CMJ showcase that prominently featured saloon-style brawling, tied-up prostitutes, and a gleefully urinating Rugged Man. Since then, R.A. has played the albatross, trekking the underground and garnering reputation as the Chupucabra of the underground. Aside from an appearance on Soundbombing, Vol. 1, R.A. has been an apparition, adding a celebratory import to his Nature Sounds debut. Now, the ghost finally speaks. No one can walk away from Die Rugged Man Die without a clear sense of who R.A. is: The man has a gift for autobiography and he draws the listener with the familiarity of a fireside, storytelling uncle. Granted he's the uncle who takes shits on your face while you sleep. Against Nilez' dawdling guitars on \\\"A Star is Born\\\", R.A. regurgitates his griminess as a Jive Records leper: \\\"'They say he's a beast, he's a creature/ Keep him in the other room, don't let him see Aaliyah.\\\" All vulgar showmanship aside, Rugged Man addresses subjects with clarity and humor. On the album's single \\\"Lessons\\\", he deftly caricatures the myopic label execs who stifled his career as a white rapper. Rising producer Koran pushes a pre-school child's vocals over Fischer-Price keyboards as R.A. jests: \\\"They say maybe if you had Dr. Dre or Timbaland/They say a white boy need a black boy to win/ Bubba Sparxxx did and so did Slim/ Just Blaze is hot. Why don't you get with him?\\\" Concerned with the trends of hip-hop consumers, R.A. fires a simple critique on the memory-lane ballad \\\"On the Block\\\": \\\"Now that rich kids love [hip-hop], so fuck the poor kids now.\\\" As a composite, however, Die Rugged Man fails to rework the well-worn, preachy \\\"mainstream=cancer\\\" equation. Aside from establishing his bad luck with majors, R.A.'s complaints often pose as a subconscious bid for sympathy, which is difficult considering his implosion from self-induced calamities. Why care about R.A's tales if he unflinchingly claims on \\\"Dumb\\\" that he doesn't give a fuck about his career? Nonetheless, the completion of Die Rugged Man is a triumph in itself. Hip-hop's Forrest Gump has seen almost everything and tells his story well. Let's hope things at Nature Sounds stay civil so we don't have to wait another decade for his next album.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"\\n    Artist: Guided by Voices,\\nAlbum: Alien Lanes,\\nGenre: Rock,\\nScore (1-10): 9.2\\n    \\nAlbum review:\\n\\\"The passage of time has done nothing to make the mid-\\u201990s heyday of Guided by Voices seem any less extraordinary. Released at the height of the band\\u2019s underground popularity in 1995, Alien Lanes supposedly cost $10 to make (excluding the cost of the beer consumed as it was recorded) while garnering GBV an advance worth nearly $100,000 from its new record label, Matador. GBV\\u2019s 37-year-old mastermind and only permanent member, Robert Pollard, had already been around a while, recording\\u00a0several albums in the \\u201980s and early \\u201990s that virtually nobody heard. But Pollard\\u2019s latest opus was a big deal:\\u00a0famous mastering engineer Bob Ludwig\\u00a0mastered Alien Lanes. (Among Ludwig's prior credits was Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska, possibly the most celebrated \\\"lo-fi\\\" album ever.) Upon release, Alien Lanes was greeted with a laudatory four-star review in Rolling Stone comparing GBV to the twin pillars of \\u201990s alt-rock, R.E.M. and Nirvana. \\u201cThe new drunk drivers/Have hoisted the flag,\\u201d Pollard sings on Alien Lanes\\u2019 opening track, \\u201cA Salty Salute.\\u201d The bravado was warranted. Bandcamp has since normalized the idea of a bedroom tunesmith from flyover country releasing a self-recorded masterpiece to the world, and getting semi-famous in the process. Will Toledo was once a high school kid from Virginia who wrote and recorded dozens of songs in the backseat of his parents\\u2019 car, and now Car Seat Headrest is one of 2016\\u2019s biggest new indie bands. But the lack of online distribution channels was hardly GBV\\u2019s only disadvantage before Alien Lanes. By the time GBV\\u2019s would-be swan song, 1992\\u2019s Propeller**, became a surprise critical hit, Pollard was a family man from Dayton, Ohio, who by rock\\u2018n\\u2019roll standards was over-the-hill. By day, he\\u00a0worked as an elementary schoolteacher, and on weekends, he blew off steam by getting drunk in his garage and laying down weird, succinct, and insanely catchy songs informed by \\u201960s and \\u201970s prog and psych-rock on a four-track machine with guys from the neighborhood. And for many years, that was basically the extent of Pollard\\u2019s music career. Even after GBV finally made its mark, Pollard\\u2019s unabashed devotion to the less\\u00a0fashionable sectors of classic rock (Peter Gabriel-era Genesis, Who\\u2019s Next, Cheap Trick)\\u00a0put him out-of-step with indie\\u2019s entrenched punk orthodoxy. \\u201cKing Crimson with a short attention span and a sixpack,\\u201d was how Craig Marks described Guided by Voices in the Spin Alternative Record Guide, published just as the band\\u2019s notoriety was peaking. While the King Crimson comparison would\\u2019ve flattered Pollard, it wasn\\u2019t meant as a compliment in the alt-era. What Guided by Voices lacked in traditional indie cool, it made up for in songs. So many, many songs\\u2014great songs, bad songs, OK\\u00a0songs that became good because they were short and worked as segues between the great songs. With 28 tracks dispensed in just 41 minutes, Alien Lanes offered up more songs than any other GBV album, and they were dense with in-jokes and non-sequiturs about a pimple zoo, the Amazing Rockethead, and Baron Von Richtofen, among other obscurities. Pollard\\u2019s method was to write five duds in order to get one perfect tune, and then release all six songs. In the end, making art was like breathing for Pollard\\u2014you can\\u2019t inhale oxygen without exhaling carbon dioxide. GBV also had mystique to burn.

But his stock-in-trade is moody, gargatuanly stringed incidental music for hysterically overblown movies like Moulin Rouge and Plunkett and MacLean. The appropriately titled As If to Nothing follows on from his 101-Strings-for-Jaded-Dullards debut, The Space Between Us, and repeats the same formula throughout its sixty-nine minutes, just as its predecessor did. Though some might say that Armstrong's music is powerfully evocative and serene, such people hate music and all its subtle possibilities and intricacies. Plus, if Armstrong perceives that music can be subtle, intricate and meaningful, this album goes strenuously out of its way to demonstrate the opposite. An Armstrong piece is short and unobtrusive, which, for movie producers, means Armstrong's an affordable alternative to James Horner or John Williams. While no director really wants an audience distracted by a heavenly orchestral piece from his or her images, I expect something more eventful for home listening than billows of strings interrupted in the politest way by French horns or a soaring oboe. Perhaps aware of the limitations of his instrumentals, Armstrong enlisted help: drum-n-bass master Photek, soul crooner David McAlmont, Alpha vocalist Wendy Stubbs, Antye Greie-Fuchs from German glitchers Laub, Bono, Mogwai and even Lemonheaded lost boy Evan Dando took time out from their otherwise productive lives to take part in this effete twaddle. Rumor has it that a small town was built to house and support all the musicians involved in realizing Armstrong's bland vision. Divided into two camps: hundreds of Musicians' Union schlubs, and those star performers the liners classify as \\\"featured artist.\\\" But anyone wandering into Armstrong's shanty town could distinguish the two classes by whether they had a limo pick them up from their temporary accommodation or whether they had to ride Shank's pony to the studio. Once seated in front of the music stands, the majority of the performers probably chuckled at how childishly simple Armstrong's score is, and how repetitious. All string players are asked to play languidly and high, piling on mock emotion by the shovelful. Horn players are similarly asked to underpin the insipidly swollen string gestures with mannered blasts. Percussion is left to programmers, who borrow heavily from Massive Attack's Mezzanine loops. Any discerning listener must hope that the \\\"featured artists\\\" will crack through the sickly sweet monotony. The juxtaposition of sweeping strings and Mogwai could have been fascinating, had Mogwai's contribution not been erased in post-production. I can detect no trace of them during \\\"Miracle,\\\" the piece on which they're credited. Photek suffers identically. I'm at a loss to find Photek amid the generic trip-hop beats of \\\"Hymn 2,\\\" and the addition of soprano soloist Catherine Bott to the track makes it seem as though Armstrong constructed this song solely for those wishing to augment their Enya and Enigma collections. Despite Armstrong declaring in a Guardian newspaper interview that Antye Greie-Fuchs' band Laub are reminiscent of Stockhausen, he (maliciously?) reduces her vocals to exotic curiosity during \\\"Waltz.\\\" Fuchs babbles away in German and occasionally English making no sense and leaving the majority of listeners with a very dim view of her mental health. Bono gets to redo his vocals for U2's chestnut, \\\"Stay (Faraway, So Close),\\\" and reveals that despite his striving for Scott Walker's baritone, the best he'll ever achieve is Michael Bolton's. David McAlmont, former Thieves vocalist and collaborator with ex-London Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, fairs far better, which really is damning him with faint praise. During \\\"Snow,\\\" McAlmont taps into the powerful soulful pathos that made songs like \\\"Yes\\\" (from The Sound of McAlmont and Butler) such stunners. But again, Armstrong bludgeons McAlmont with the orchestra, perhaps out of jealousy. McAlmont is capable of real emotion, not Armstrong's ersatz approximation of feeling. I find Armstrong's successful career bewildering, given the extremely narrow musical ability he displays throughout this album. A case in point is \\\"Starless II,\\\" a piece that incorporates a chunk of Robert Fripp's guitar solo from King Crimson's \\\"Starless.\\\" The extent of Armstrong's ability is to mimic exactly the notes Fripp plays in the string section, which is a stultifying waste of everyone's time. The strings attach themselves like barnacles to Fripp's guitar and refuse to be shaken loose. Another instrumental, \\\"Ruthless Gravity,\\\" demonstrates just how conservative an electronic label Astralwerks can be. Token blips begin the song before a deluge of syrupy unison strings shove the sound of the new out of the way. For me, \\\"Ruthless Gravity\\\" typifies Astralwerks' partially concealed loathing of innovation. Just one look at their roster and you'll see example after example of shoddy talent and crummy back-in-the-day-ism. Despite the prevalence of vapid schlock, As If to Nothing displays one genuine surprise in Evan Dando. Dando brings a maturity and sensitivity that I had hitherto not suspected he was capable of. Though the song, \\\"Wake Up in New York,\\\" lifts sections from Kate Bush's \\\"Moments of Pleasure,\\\" Dando's reserved solemnity gives As If to Nothing a grace it doesn't deserve. Armstrong does superbly to restrain himself from augmenting Dando with anything but an acoustic guitar for the first fifty seconds. But inevitably, Armstrong wants the spotlight trained back on him and lobs string salvoes to crush Dando's affecting delivery. The title As If to Nothing fits this execrable CD perfectly.

But his stock-in-trade is moody, gargatuanly stringed incidental music for hysterically overblown movies like Moulin Rouge and Plunkett and MacLean. The appropriately titled As If to Nothing follows on from his 101-Strings-for-Jaded-Dullards debut, The Space Between Us, and repeats the same formula throughout its sixty-nine minutes, just as its predecessor did. Though some might say that Armstrong's music is powerfully evocative and serene, such people hate music and all its subtle possibilities and intricacies. Plus, if Armstrong perceives that music can be subtle, intricate and meaningful, this album goes strenuously out of its way to demonstrate the opposite. An Armstrong piece is short and unobtrusive, which, for movie producers, means Armstrong's an affordable alternative to James Horner or John Williams. While no director really wants an audience distracted by a heavenly orchestral piece from his or her images, I expect something more eventful for home listening than billows of strings interrupted in the politest way by French horns or a soaring oboe. Perhaps aware of the limitations of his instrumentals, Armstrong enlisted help: drum-n-bass master Photek, soul crooner David McAlmont, Alpha vocalist Wendy Stubbs, Antye Greie-Fuchs from German glitchers Laub, Bono, Mogwai and even Lemonheaded lost boy Evan Dando took time out from their otherwise productive lives to take part in this effete twaddle. Rumor has it that a small town was built to house and support all the musicians involved in realizing Armstrong's bland vision. Divided into two camps: hundreds of Musicians' Union schlubs, and those star performers the liners classify as \\\"featured artist.\\\" But anyone wandering into Armstrong's shanty town could distinguish the two classes by whether they had a limo pick them up from their temporary accommodation or whether they had to ride Shank's pony to the studio. Once seated in front of the music stands, the majority of the performers probably chuckled at how childishly simple Armstrong's score is, and how repetitious. All string players are asked to play languidly and high, piling on mock emotion by the shovelful. Horn players are similarly asked to underpin the insipidly swollen string gestures with mannered blasts. Percussion is left to programmers, who borrow heavily from Massive Attack's Mezzanine loops. Any discerning listener must hope that the \\\"featured artists\\\" will crack through the sickly sweet monotony. The juxtaposition of sweeping strings and Mogwai could have been fascinating, had Mogwai's contribution not been erased in post-production. I can detect no trace of them during \\\"Miracle,\\\" the piece on which they're credited. Photek suffers identically. I'm at a loss to find Photek amid the generic trip-hop beats of \\\"Hymn 2,\\\" and the addition of soprano soloist Catherine Bott to the track makes it seem as though Armstrong constructed this song solely for those wishing to augment their Enya and Enigma collections. Despite Armstrong declaring in a Guardian newspaper interview that Antye Greie-Fuchs' band Laub are reminiscent of Stockhausen, he (maliciously?) reduces her vocals to exotic curiosity during \\\"Waltz.\\\" Fuchs babbles away in German and occasionally English making no sense and leaving the majority of listeners with a very dim view of her mental health. Bono gets to redo his vocals for U2's chestnut, \\\"Stay (Faraway, So Close),\\\" and reveals that despite his striving for Scott Walker's baritone, the best he'll ever achieve is Michael Bolton's. David McAlmont, former Thieves vocalist and collaborator with ex-London Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, fairs far better, which really is damning him with faint praise. During \\\"Snow,\\\" McAlmont taps into the powerful soulful pathos that made songs like \\\"Yes\\\" (from The Sound of McAlmont and Butler) such stunners. But again, Armstrong bludgeons McAlmont with the orchestra, perhaps out of jealousy. McAlmont is capable of real emotion, not Armstrong's ersatz approximation of feeling. I find Armstrong's successful career bewildering, given the extremely narrow musical ability he displays throughout this album. A case in point is \\\"Starless II,\\\" a piece that incorporates a chunk of Robert Fripp's guitar solo from King Crimson's \\\"Starless.\\\" The extent of Armstrong's ability is to mimic exactly the notes Fripp plays in the string section, which is a stultifying waste of everyone's time. The strings attach themselves like barnacles to Fripp's guitar and refuse to be shaken loose. Another instrumental, \\\"Ruthless Gravity,\\\" demonstrates just how conservative an electronic label Astralwerks can be. Token blips begin the song before a deluge of syrupy unison strings shove the sound of the new out of the way. For me, \\\"Ruthless Gravity\\\" typifies Astralwerks' partially concealed loathing of innovation. Just one look at their roster and you'll see example after example of shoddy talent and crummy back-in-the-day-ism. Despite the prevalence of vapid schlock, As If to Nothing displays one genuine surprise in Evan Dando. Dando brings a maturity and sensitivity that I had hitherto not suspected he was capable of. Though the song, \\\"Wake Up in New York,\\\" lifts sections from Kate Bush's \\\"Moments of Pleasure,\\\" Dando's reserved solemnity gives As If to Nothing a grace it doesn't deserve. Armstrong does superbly to restrain himself from augmenting Dando with anything but an acoustic guitar for the first fifty seconds. But inevitably, Armstrong wants the spotlight trained back on him and lobs string salvoes to crush Dando's affecting delivery. The title As If to Nothing fits this execrable CD perfectly. Putting aside for a moment Armstrong's neutering of his \\\"featured artists,\\\" what galls me is his rootlessness. I can detect no affiliation with or reference to any classical tradition. I'm not asking him to wave the Darmstadt or Vienna gang sign, but at least show an awareness of the intricacies of composition other than those mandated by the Muzak Corporation. Though this record courts an audience who despises creativity and innovation, it will disappoint even them by not giving them a single decent melody to hum along to. At least Moby gave his audience \\\"South Side\\\" and \\\"Porcelain.\\\" The dominant force of any Armstrong piece, the strings, are a unified mass, undifferentiated and relentless in their turgid banality.

With that contrast between push and pull in mind, Altar-- written and recorded largely before a joint tour last fall-- risks leaving an audience stranded in the middle by inertia. Indeed, the second half of Altar does just that, leaving the audience adrift in left field with little direction or purpose. But, together, the first three tracks are a perfect capitulation of their conjoined aesthetics. Opener \\\"Etna\\\" creeps in through feedback and slowly building and shifting bass tones before a huge guitar sweep-- split between Sunn 0)))'s Greg Anderson and Boris' Takeshi-- takes charge a minute in. A veritable war of tones follows, Boris drummer Atsuo filling the low-lying space between the subterranean guitar arches with cymbal rolls. Six minutes later, the air forces-- piercing, upper-register, signature-Boris guitar attacks-- obliterate the lowly, warring miscreants, razing the drama and letting it slow burn into \\\"N.L.T.\\\" The follow-up-- featuring the bowed bass of Sunn 0))) collaborator Bill Herzog-- is a vibrantly bleak and texturally captivating work reminiscent of Daniel Menche. Atsuo-- the only other musician present-- splatters the canvas, lustrous edges shaped from the sound of bowed cymbals and a carefully managed gong. It's followed by Altar\\u2019s centerpiece and masterpiece, \\\"The Sinking Belle (Blue Sheep)\\\". \\\"Belle\\\" is the one track on which its players conspire to subvert outside notions of both bands. Sunn 0)))'s glacial motion is intact, as is Boris' lucid use of almost-gentle tones. But the amplifiers are turned down, and distortion is all but lost. Instead, warm analog delay lets the sound drift in plumes, and beautiful, understated slide guitars and O'Malley's careful piano create a cradle for Jesse Sykes. Here, her voice shifts and floats like the retiring wafts of blue-gray smoke from a funeral pyre at a misty dawn. It\\u2019s an exhalation, a last breath of robust beauty. But, on the heels of such an overwhelming, unexpected triptych, Altar never recovers, essentially moving in redundant circles for 32 minutes. Three tracks either highlight the magic Sunn 0))) and Boris have crafted separately for a decade or the pitfalls that such work has avoided. The deftly fragmented chords that end \\\"The Sinking Belle\\\" open the door for the record's second side, but \\\"Akuma No Kuma\\\" is waylaid early by a harangued vocal take, an out-of-place horn fanfare, and overly involved Moog lines. Wata's eerie voice and the nebulous echo on everything in \\\"Fried Eagle Mind\\\" builds a paranoid sleep-state eclipsed after seven minutes by a solid sheet of guitar noise. It fades barely, slamming hard into \\\"Bloodswamp\\\", a 14-minute, multi-textural drone that would be an accomplishment for most other bands. Asymmetrical and leaning, Altar isn't the metal icon its lineage would suggest: It bears neither the rapturous juggernaut geography of Sunn 0)))'s White 2 or Black One nor the transcendent overpowered amorphousness of Boris' Pink or Amplifier Worship. But it does speak of things to come, brave new directions for bands respectively referred to hitherto either as sheer sonic titans or on-off schizophrenics. Those descriptions are much too reductive, and such evidence is the onus and gift of Altar.\",\n          \"Neill Jameson ranks among the great defenders of and disciples for United States Black Metal. He\\u2019s been making and refining his own antagonistic strain since the mid-1990s, leading Krieg through some of the most important, compelling and twisted stateside versions of the form. He\\u2019s run a label and become a crucial distribution point for many acts, welcomed outsiders into the dark fold, publicly defended the acquisition of Thurston Moore by his supergroup Twilight, and dismissed insider and old friend Blake Judd as an expression of the genre at its solipsistic worst. He\\u2019s advocated for progression in the form by endorsing the firebrands of Liturgy while maintaining that the genre must stay tough and unruly unless it wants to become as weak as water. \\u201cI have boots that are older than most of these people\\u2019s interest in black metal,\\u201d he once said, swiftly encapsulating his admixture of old-school aggression and excitable acceptance. \\u201cI figure black metal is probably just a curiosity for the white-belt crowd.\\u2026 I\\u2019m not as bothered by it as some people are; it\\u2019s just the evolution of things.\\u201d Transient is Krieg\\u2019s first album in four years, second since a necessary hiatus, and first featuring Jameson surrounded by a new quartet. Moreover, it\\u2019s an hour-long expression of Jameson\\u2019s defensive and defiant attitude, as it sprawls from a base of recalcitrant black metal in intriguing, unexpected directions. A uniformly desolate album, Transient is a claustrophobic listen that provides the illusion of walls closing in and ceilings coming down, even as its sound opens wider. Though the core of Krieg and these 11 songs remains primitive black metal, epitomized by mid-album melee \\u201cAtlas with a Broken Arm\\u201d, the album serves as a reminder that Jameson has never been one for stasis. He\\u2019s shifted Krieg\\u2019s lineup between most albums, covered the Velvet Underground in a croaking acoustic guise, and massaged a broad spectrum of influences into this band. Transient leans hard into those outlier aims: Some moments shimmer with the pop-metal buoyancy that temporarily worked as Nachtmystium\\u2019s calling card, while others burrow into slow, strong doom wallops. There are orchestrated power electronics interludes and hardcore stomp-alongs, solemn spoken-word passages and taut post-punk counter-riffs. Jameson\\u2019s boots are ostensibly meant for hiking. But credit goes to Jameson\\u2019s irascible voice\\u2014here, the best it\\u2019s ever been\\u2014for threading together these disparate musical thoughts and giving the record its overriding sense of desperation. No matter the particular song\\u2019s style or structure, he plays the part of the reprobate. He bellows like a bully during the hardcore half of \\u201cReturn Fire\\u201d and screams in agony when it downshifts in the back, a madman melting in his own sweat. Krieg recorded Transient at the Rhode Island studio Machines with Magnets, a room perhaps best known for its work with The Body. You can hear that duo\\u2019s echoes during the brilliant cover of Amebix\\u2019s \\u201cWinter\\u201d, which pivots from brief black metal builds into bottomless doom tirades. Above a rhythm section that suggests orchestrated artillery fire, Jameson lashes out as though he\\u2019s being interred by the force of his own band. In fact, he delivers much of Transient as though he\\u2019s singing beneath the outfit, fighting to be heard among the din of guitars and drums. That choice makes Transient both bleak and beguiling; Jameson sounds trapped, but you want to lean in close, dangerously so, to hear what he has to yell. Even during \\u201cWalk With Them Unnoticed,\\u201d that particularly upbeat and racing number, his hoarse tone comes tucked just beneath the lip of the lead, making even the album\\u2019s most breathless and accessible bit feel hazardous. Though Jameson emerged as a one-man black metal band, first under the name Imperial and later as Krieg, he\\u2019s a rich collaborator, too. His roster of past alliances and collaborations is the length of a few paragraphs, and he\\u2019s one of only two people to appear on every Twilight album. He\\u2019s made doom with March into the Sea and tortured prismatic weirdness with N.I.L., and his willingness to work with others is a crucial component of Transient, a record that benefits from pulling Jameson out of his own head. Opener \\u201cOrder of the Solitary Road\\u201d starts slow, turns into a sprint, manages to pick up the pace yet again and ultimately staggers off into the distance; it\\u2019s a full-band feat, motivated by the drums but pulled along by Alex Poole\\u2019s spectacularly assorted riffs. In the span of six minutes, he lands a perfectly slow, steely melody at the start and, near the middle, a grim, low-lying theme. And then there\\u2019s \\u201cHome\\u201d, a long spoken-word cold stare and the sort of oddity that provides a welcome stopgap before the record\\u2019s charged finale. Over eerie, failed-transmission electronics, Integrity\\u2019s Dwid Hellion and Thurston Moore trade stanzas about absence and loneliness. \\u201cThe only home I know anymore is that of discomfort,\\u201d Moore reads, \\u201ca feeling of displacement which resides inside of me wherever I go.\\u201d The plainspoken text reinforces the album\\u2019s depressive atmosphere, which can be intuited but, thanks to Jameson\\u2019s delivery, never quite confirmed or dissected. It gives more breadth to those feelings, providing what started as solitary laments from a one-man band the benefit of misery in good company.\",\n          \"It may be hard to believe in these days of Arcade Fires, Broken Social Scenes, New Pornographers, Constantines, Black Mountains, and, yes, Avrils, but in the mid-1990s, being Canadian and not named Alanis or Shania was enough to get you dropped from your label. Playing quintessential power-pop while signed to grunge-oriented major Geffen didn't help. At any rate, Sloan's lack of U.S. commercial success in the 1990s represents the nadir of U.S.-Canuck relations between \\\"54 40 or Fight!\\\" and that government official calling Dubya a \\\"moron\\\" in 2002-- yeah, I'm including \\\"Informer\\\". A Sides Win captures most of the high points along this Halifax, Nova Scotia-based quartet's career arc and adds two adequate new songs, all in the blessedly sensible chronological order too many singles comps eschew. Representing 1993 debut Smeared, the ambitiously geeky \\\"Underwhelmed\\\" and dreamy \\\"500 Up\\\" open the record, distending the band's typical hook-filled melodies with swirling guitars that hint at both Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. 1994 follow-up Twice Removed yields the concentrated melodic O.J. of \\\"Coax Me\\\"-- \\\"it's not the band I hate, it's their fans!\\\"-- and dull post-shoegaze \\\"People of the Sky\\\". This is where Sloan began to carve out their niche as a power-pop band, and also where their chances for American stardom were squandered amid Geffen's lack of marketing support. Sloan's crowning achievement remains 1996's gloriously catchy One Chord to Another, which fulfilled its predecessor's promise with punchy tunes indebted to Graham Nash-era Hollies and, of course, that Fabbest of Fours. Unsurprisingly, tracks from that album are A Sides Win's peak. \\\"The Lines You Amend\\\" jangles like \\\"The Ballad of John & Yoko\\\" while name-dropping Ringo. \\\"Everything You've Done Wrong\\\" skips along to handclaps and trumpets far sunnier than its title. \\\"The Good in Everyone\\\" concisely summarizes Sloan's style, anchoring sunny British Invasion harmonies in crunchy power chords. While most of the tracks taken from Sloan's subsequent four studio albums reflect the band's descent into clunky riff-rock that owes as much to AC/DC and KISS as to power-pop icons like Big Star or Zumpano, Pretty Together's \\\"The Other Man\\\" is a glistening alt-rocker supposedly inspired by bassist Chris Murphy's inserting himself (ahem) between Broken Social Scene's Andrew Whiteman and Canadian songstress Feist. O indie Canada! Sloan are a better singles band than an albums band, so A Sides Win all but atones for their sometimes underwhelming (ha!) latter-day failings. Even 2003's Action Pact sounds brilliant when its sole inclusion is jaunty, contemplative \\\"The Rest of My Life\\\". The two new songs don't exactly hint at a renaissance, but at least they show a band still rummaging for new classic rock inspiration-- the Cars-like palm-muting and synths of \\\"Try to Make It\\\", the can't-drive-just-55 riff-churner \\\"All Used Up\\\". All that said, listeners just discovering Sloan would still be better off buying One Chord to Another.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"augmented_review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\n    Artist: Sunn O))) & Boris,\\nAlbum: Altar,\\nGenre: None,\\nScore (1-10): 6.6\\n    \\nAlbum review:\\n\\\"Longtime Southern Lord labelmates, tourmates, and metal bands Sunn 0))) and Boris seem like natural collaborators, though they approach their music with disparate intentions: Sunn 0)))'s blood-covered drone subsumes everything around it, while Boris' blend of patiently unraveling noise and fractious thrash entices and then dramatically repels an audience. With that contrast between push and pull in mind, Altar-- written and recorded largely before a joint tour last fall-- risks leaving an audience stranded in the middle by inertia. Indeed, the second half of Altar does just that, leaving the audience adrift in left field with little direction or purpose. But, together, the first three tracks are a perfect capitulation of their conjoined aesthetics. Opener \\\"Etna\\\" creeps in through feedback and slowly building and shifting bass tones before a huge guitar sweep-- split between Sunn 0)))'s Greg Anderson and Boris' Takeshi-- takes charge a minute in. A veritable war of tones follows, Boris drummer Atsuo filling the low-lying space between the subterranean guitar arches with cymbal rolls. Six minutes later, the air forces-- piercing, upper-register, signature-Boris guitar attacks-- obliterate the lowly, warring miscreants, razing the drama and letting it slow burn into \\\"N.L.T.\\\" The follow-up-- featuring the bowed bass of Sunn 0))) collaborator Bill Herzog-- is a vibrantly bleak and texturally captivating work reminiscent of Daniel Menche. Atsuo-- the only other musician present-- splatters the canvas, lustrous edges shaped from the sound of bowed cymbals and a carefully managed gong. It's followed by Altar\\u2019s centerpiece and masterpiece, \\\"The Sinking Belle (Blue Sheep)\\\". \\\"Belle\\\" is the one track on which its players conspire to subvert outside notions of both bands. Sunn 0)))'s glacial motion is intact, as is Boris' lucid use of almost-gentle tones. But the amplifiers are turned down, and distortion is all but lost. Instead, warm analog delay lets the sound drift in plumes, and beautiful, understated slide guitars and O'Malley's careful piano create a cradle for Jesse Sykes.

The deftly fragmented chords that end \\\"The Sinking Belle\\\" open the door for the record's second side, but \\\"Akuma No Kuma\\\" is waylaid early by a harangued vocal take, an out-of-place horn fanfare, and overly involved Moog lines. Wata's eerie voice and the nebulous echo on everything in \\\"Fried Eagle Mind\\\" builds a paranoid sleep-state eclipsed after seven minutes by a solid sheet of guitar noise.
